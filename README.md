# Credit Risk Modeling Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **credit risk prediction model** using real-world customer, loan, and bureau data. The goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to default on their loan.  

The dataset includes information such as:  
- Customer demographics  
- Employment & income details  
- Loan characteristics  
- Credit bureau characteristics  
- Repayment behavior  

---

## Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed relationships between features and target variable using plots and summary statistics.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like **loan-to-income ratio**, **utilization ratio**, and others to enhance model performance.  

---

## Modeling Approach
- Built a **baseline Logistic Regression** model.  
- Implemented **advanced ML models** for improved predictive accuracy.  
- Evaluated models using metrics such as **ROC-AUC Curve** and **Classification Report**.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

---

## Key Takeaways
- Identified key factors contributing to loan default.  
- Demonstrated how machine learning can support **credit risk decisions**.  
- Achieved robust model performance with interpretable results.
